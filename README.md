# Convolutional-neural-network - Chart Pattern Recognition

### Description
- Chart Pattern Image Recognition - Identify chart patterns by Convolutional Neural Networks 


### Model Type 
- Convolutional Neural Network
06-10-2022

### Version - V1.0 Beta

### Goals:
- Build a chart pattern image recognition model and evaluate if chart patterns are usefull to predict future prices in the market

### Version Updates
- Importing pickle data
- Add layers 
- Fit the model 
- Test the model using your own Images


### Future implementations 
- Add more data to the dataset
- Add Automated Download dataset from google images 
- Add other CATEGORIES such as Flags, Pennant, Cup and handle and so on. 
- Add Auto Test Image from any Chart 
- Evaluate how usefull chart patterns are to predict future prices

# Convolutional-neural-network - Chart Pattern Recognition

### Description
- Chart Pattern Image Recognition - Identify chart patterns using Convolutional Neural Networks 


### Model Type 
- Convolutional Neural Network
06-10-2022

### Version - V1.0 Beta

### Goals:
- Build a chart pattern image recognition model and evaluate if chart patterns are useful to predict future prices in the market

### Key Notes and Insights
- At this time the model is only able to classify the charts as bullish or bearish 
- You should add images to the dataset if you wish to improve the model 

### Version Updates
- Importing pickle data
- Add layers 
- Fit the model 
- Test the model using your own Images


### Future implementations 
- Add more data to the dataset
- Add Automated Download dataset from google images 
- Add other CATEGORIES such as Flags, Pennant, Cup and Handle and so on. 
- Add Auto Test Image from any Chart 
- Evaluate how useful chart patterns are to predict future prices

# Convolutional-neural-network - Chart Pattern Recognition

### Description
- Chart Pattern Image Recognition - Identify chart patterns using Convolutional Neural Networks 


### Model Type 
- Convolutional Neural Network
06-10-2022

### Version - V1.0 Beta

### Goals:
- Build a chart pattern image recognition model and evaluate if chart patterns are useful to predict future prices in the market

### Key Notes and Insights
- At this time the model is only able to classify the charts as bullish or bearish 
- You should add images to the dataset if you wish to improve the model 

### Version Updates
- Live test added
- Live Classification added 
- Candlestick chart added 
- Importing pickle data
- Add layers 
- Fit the model 
- Test the model using your own Images


### Future implementations 
- Plot multiple charts
- Add more data to the dataset
- Add Automated Download dataset from google images 
- Add more CATEGORIES such as Flags, Pennant, Cup and handle and so on. 
- Add Auto Test Image from any Chart  
- Plot Multiple Chart Symbols and Multiple Chart time frames  
- Store prediction 
- Store real market direction 
- compare with different targets 
- run loop to get best parameters and results 
- Set Cross validation to be able to save parameters 
- Set auto run
- Evaluate Results on multiple charts
- Save correct predictions and add it to training dataset (Auto Feed) 
- Identify potential targets 
- Add Break out as bullish with target 
- Identify specific chart patterns such as breakouts 
- Set Screener    
- If there is any patterns useful it should identify and classify it
